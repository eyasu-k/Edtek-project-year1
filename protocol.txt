This file contains the protocol used by the client and the server.

client -> server protocols:

    command:data:data2:data3:data_n
    #valid commands are: "upload", "download", "list", "delete"
    # data and data2 can be anything according to the command type.

    example of the commands:

        "upload":
            the protocol to upload a file: command:filename:size
            example: upload:file.txt:1024:(file content as a string)

            the client will send the file contents right after sending the upload request.
            if a file with the same name exists in the server, the file will be overwritten.
        "download":
            the protocol to download a file: command:filename
            example: download:file.txt

            after sending the download request, the client will receive the file contents.
        
        "list":
            the protocol to get a list of files: command (no data needed.)
            example: list
        
        "delete":
            the protocol to delete a file: command:filename
            example: delete:file.txt
        
server -> client protocols:
     command:data
     #valid commands are: "success", "r_list"
     #'data' is always a comma separated strings or a plain string.
    
    example of the commands:

        "success":
            this command is sent when a command from the client is successful, else an error is sent. (check the "error" response)

        "r_list":
            this command is a response for the "list" command: r_list:filename;file size, file2name ;file2 size
            example: r_list:file.txt;file.txt size, file2.txt; file2.txt size, file3.example; file3.example size
